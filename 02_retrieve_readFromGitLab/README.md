# Retrieve: read from GitLab

## Goal

- Retrieve only the `isa.investigation.xlsx` file from available (accessible) ARCs
  - Without cloning the full ARC
  - Platin: retrieve only `INVESTIGATION` section of the `isa.investigation.xlsx`

## Alternative

- Clone full ARC to temp dump
- Extract info and rm ARC
- Note: ignore large (git-lfs) data
